Assistant director David Halls called out “cold gun” when handing Baldwin the weapon, the AD wrote in an affidavit, according to the New York Times. “Cold” means no ammunition is in the gun.

They accused the production of not properly following safety protocols, including gun inspections. The workers claimed that there were two accidental gun discharges on set before, with Baldwin’s stunt double allegedly firing a gun that was announced as “cold” only to find a live round in it.“There should have been an investigation into what happened,” a crew member alleged to the LA Times. “There were no safety meetings. There was no assurance that it wouldn’t happen again. All they wanted to do was rush, rush, rush.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_editorial_10332078bk.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[How Did Other Sets React?]]>&lt;![CDATA[Many film and TV sets are taking action and vowing not to risk having “hot” or “live” meaning loaded weapons on set.

The safety of our cast and crew is too important.”Amazon Prime’sThe Boys, which is known for its violent action sequences, will also forgo live rounds. ShowrunnerEric Kripke, who worked with Rust cast memberJensen AcklesonSupernaturalandThe Boys, announced the news on Friday viaTwitter. “In [Hutchins’] memory, a simple, easy pledge: no more guns with blanks on any of my sets ever.

During a September 2021 episode of the “Voices of West” podcast, the former model admitted “the best part” of her job was “just showing people who are normally kind of freaked out by guns how safe they can be and how they’re not really problematic unless put in the wrong hands.”Reed is the daughter of longtime armorer Thell Reed, who was Brad Pitt’s shooting coach on the 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. However, the 24-year-old had only worked on one movie before landing the role of head armorer on Baldwin's western.The Hollywood rookie noted she had “figured” out most of the job's requirements on “my own” and said that “loading blanks” is the “scariest thing to me.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Halyna-Hutchins-memorial-after-Rust-shooting.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[The Armorer Says She 'Has No Idea' Why Live Rounds Were in the Gun]]>&lt;![CDATA[Gutierrez Reed's lawyers, Jason Bowles and Robert Gorence, released a statement to Us in October 2021."First Hannah would like to extend her deepest and most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Halyna," the statement read, referring to Hutchins as "an inspirational woman in film who Hannah looked up to."The statement went on to allege that she had been "slandered" in the aftermath of the shooting."Safety is Hannah’s number one priority on set. Ultimately this set would never have been compromised if live ammo were not introduced," the lawyers claimed on her behalf. "Hannah has no idea where the live rounds came from. Hannah and the prop master gained control over the guns and she never witnessed anyone shoot live rounds with these guns and nor would she permit that. They were locked up every night and at lunch and there’s no way a single one of them was unaccounted for or being shot by crew members. Hannah still, to this day, has never had an accidental discharge."Though there have been reports that there were two accidental discharges in other situations on set, Gutierrez Reed's lawyers allege that others were at fault. "The first one on this set was the prop master and the second was a stunt man after Hannah informed him his gun was hot with blanks," they alleged.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Halyna-Hutchins-memorial-after-Alec-Baldwin-movie-shooting.jpg?quality=55&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[The Armorer Wanted More Time to Prepare]]>&lt;![CDATA[Gutierrez Reed's lawyers suggested that the blame for the fatal accident lay with other filmmakers."Hannah was hired on two positions on this film, which made it extremely difficult to focus on her job as an armorer," they said in the October 2021 statement. "She fought for training, days to maintain weapons, and proper time to prepare for gunfire but ultimately was overruled by production and her department. The whole production set became unsafe due to various factors, including lack of safety meetings.

Davis’ post, which the actor shared via his Instagram account on November 2, claimed “the story being spun of us being overworked and surrounded by unsafe, chaotic conditions is bullst.”Davis stated that she “never worked more than a 12.5-hour shoot day,” saying that only happened once and “most days” were under the 12-hour mark. She recalled the day that Hutchins died, saying, “We had come off a 12-hour turnaround after an 11-hour shoot day,” noting they had a “56-hour weekend right before” the prolonged day. “No one was too tired to do their jobs,” she said.She refuted claims that the producers on the film didn’t care about their crew, writing, “They were some of the most approachable and warm producers I’ve ever worked with.” Davis explained that “concerns were heard and addressed” by the producers. According to her, the crew had a union rep who told production “not to give in to the camera crew” demands because they were asking for things that “the union does not require.”Davis alleged that she has spoken with the producers on the project since the accident, and they told her they have chosen not to defend themselves against the “blatantly false accusations” because they want the “focus to be on Halyna” and they want to “grieve and recover.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alec-Baldwin-Hollywood-Needs-Police-Officers-Set-After-Rust-Tragedy-0001.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Police Protection?]]>&lt;![CDATA[“Every film/TV set that uses guns, fake or otherwise, should have a police officer on set, hired by the production, to specifically monitor weapons safety,” Baldwin tweeted in November 2021.

The writers of the note clarified that the note had "not been sanctioned or influenced in any way by the producers,” but was intended to "express a more accurate account" of their "workplace tragedy." The letter stated that Hutchins was the “heart of the production” and “losing her hurt every single one of us." "We are hurting from the loss of our togetherness, our spirit, and the loss of our labor,” the message continued. “We are hurting for our friends that have been targeted by the public as they themselves grieve." While those who worked on the film said the production had its challenges, “the descriptions of Rust as a chaotic, dangerous, and exploitative workplace are false and distract from what matters the most: the memory of Halyna Hutchins, and the need to find modern alternatives to outdated industry firearm and safety practices.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investigation-Continues-Alec-Baldwin-Rust-Prop-Gun-Misfire-Everything-to-Know.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[The Investigation Continues]]>&lt;![CDATA[Police sought a warrant to obtain the Boss Baby actor's cell phone in December 2021, according to Deadline, requesting the device to determine whether there might be "any evidence relating to the death investigation of Halyna Hutchins."

"You're familiar with what fanning a gun is? Have you heard of that phrase, 'fanning the gun'? So, if you pull the hammer back, and you don’t lock the hammer ... if you pull the hammer back pretty far in old Western movies you’d see someone fan the hammer of the gun the hammer didn’t lock; you pulled it back to an extent where it would fire the bullet without you pulling the trigger, without you locking the hammer."He further emphasized: "The person who was the principal safety officer of the film declared, in front of the entire assemblage, 'This is a cold gun.'"]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Alec-Baldwin-Rust-0001.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[New Mexico District Attorney Considers Criminal Charges]]>&lt;![CDATA[Santa Fe Dist.

In court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, the actor's lawyers argued that Reeb cannot be both a state lawmaker and a special prosecutor because of the state constitution’s separation of powers provision.“Doing so vests two core powers of different branches legislating and prosecuting in the same person, and is thus barred by the plain language of Article III of the New Mexico Constitution," the motion argues before outlining what could allegedly happen in the future if Reeb is allowed to continue as the prosecutor. “Future District Attorneys could seek to curry favor with legislators who control their budgets by appointing them to high-profile cases. ... At the same time, allowing a single person to exercise both legislative and prosecutorial power could taint prosecutorial decision-making."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alec-Baldwin-Rust-Shooting-Everything-to-Know-2.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Who Are Halyna Hutchins Parent’s Suing?]]>&lt;![CDATA[Hutchins' parents, Anatolii Androsovych and Olga Solovey, and sister Svetlana Zemko, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on February 8, 2023, against Baldwin, assistant director David Halls, armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and Rust Movie Productions, LLC, according to NBC News.The allegations against the defendants included battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.
