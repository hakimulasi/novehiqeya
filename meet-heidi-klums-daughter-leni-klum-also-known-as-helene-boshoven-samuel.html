The young model was born in New York City in the United States of America. It was also here that she was raised by her parents who gave her all that she needed to grow into an energetic and gifted young woman.</p><h2><strong>Meet Leni’s Mother</strong></h2><p>As we have mentioned before, Leni’s parents are global superstars who are known around the world. Her mother, Heidi Klum, is an accomplished German and American model who is also a producer, television host, and businesswoman. She has appeared on the cover of different top-rated magazines, including the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. She is also the first German model to become a Victoria’s Secret Angel. She has been ranked second on Forbes’ list of the “World’s Top-Earning Models” and has also starred in a number of movies.</p><h2><strong>Who is Leni Klum’s Father?</strong></h2><p>Leni Klum’s father Seal, the British singer-songwriter who is regarded to be one of the most gifted singers of his generation. The singer has sold over 20 million records worldwide and has recorded several hit songs including ‘Kiss from a Rose’, ‘Crazy’, and ‘Killer’. He has topped several charts during his career and has won multiple awards as well. Some of the awards he has won include three Brit Awards as well as four Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award.</p><p>Apparently, Leni Klum is blessed to have such amazing parents who have done so well for themselves. Their huge popularity has rubbed off her and has thrown her into the public eye. In fact, on the day she was born, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">her birth made headlines</a> around the USA as newspapers announced that Heidi Klum had become a mother. As the years progressed, the media became more interested in her and so, Leni practically grew up in front of the world earning her fair share of fame in the process.</p><h3><strong>Is Seal </strong><strong>Leni Klum’s </strong><strong>Biological Father?</strong></h3><p>Today, the world knows Seal to be the father of Leni Klum whom he loves dearly. However, the interesting thing is that the singer is not actually her biological father. So, how did Seal come to be known as Leni Klum’s father? The story is quite an interesting one.</p><p>Leni Klum’s biological father is actually a man called Flavio Briatore, a popular Italian businessman and former Renault Formula One managing director. Briatore and Leni’s mother began dating in March 2003 and were head over heels in love with each other. Soon after they started dating, Heidi became pregnant with Leni and announced her pregnancy in December 2003. However, things took a sad turn between the lovers and the two broke up soon after the pregnancy was announced.</p><p>After Heidi and Briatore broke up, the model almost immediately started dating Seal. Seal, who was really in love with Heidi, took care of the model with her pregnancy and she eventually gave birth to Leni Klum on May 4, 2004. According to reports, Seal was right there to witness the birth of Leni and ensured that Heidi was in good shape. Also, Seal has always been there for Leni ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Heidi-Klum-Seal-1-2000.jpg><p>Even though Briatore is the biological father of Leni, Heidi Klum has always insisted that the Italian businessman has never been involved in Leni’s life. She has also stated emphatically that <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">“Seal is Leni’s father.”</a> This is especially because of how actively involved Seal has been in Leni’s life since her birth. In December 2004, several months after Leni’s birth, Heidi Klum and Seal got engaged. A few more months later on 10 May 2005, the couple got married on a beach in Mexico to the excitement of their family and friends.</p><p>On the 21st of November 2009, when Leni was about 5 years, her mother Heidi Klum officially adopted Seal’s surname and became legally known as Heidi Samuel. Some weeks after this, in December 2009, Seal officially adopted Leni as his daughter, and, thus, her last name was changed to Samuel. Of course, this was with the permission of Flavio Briatore.</p><h2><strong>Who are Leni Klum’s Grandparents?</strong></h2><p>Leni’s legal grandparents on her father’s (Seal) side are Adebisi Ogundeji, a Nigerian woman, and Francis Samuel, an Afro-Brazilian man. On her mother’s side, her grandparents are Erna Klum (née Berger), a hairdresser,&nbsp;and Günther Klum, a cosmetics company executive.</p><h3><strong>Leni Has Three Siblings</strong></h3><p>Leni Klum is not an only child; she has three siblings with whom she grew up. This is because after her mother Heidi got married to Seal, the couple welcomed three other children; Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel, Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel, and Lou Sulola Samuel. Leni is the first child of her parents.</p><h4><strong>Henry</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 12, 2005</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 18 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li></ul><p>About a year after Leni was born, her parents welcomed their second child, this time a boy called Henry. Henry was born on Sept. 12, 2005 and is now 18 years old. Henry has developed a close bond with his family and is especially fond of Leni.</p><p>Also, his mother, Heidi never misses the chance to celebrate his birthday with a special post on Instagram every year. In one post, she described him as the one with “the kindest heart and the biggest SMILE”</p><h4><strong>Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> November 22, 2006</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 17 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li></ul><p>Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel is Leni Klum’s second sibling who is also a boy. Johan was born on Nov. 22, 2006, and is now 17 years old. In December 2006, when he was still a baby, Johan and his mother appeared on the cover of the German magazine, Gala.</p><p>When Heidi Klum spoke about how they came about Johan’s name, the supermodel explained that in Nigerian tradition, people are given many names and that because her husband Seal, who has nine names himself, is of Nigerian descent, they decided to carry on the tradition by giving the boy several names.</p><h4><strong>Lou Sulola Samuel</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> October 9, 2009</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 14 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li></ul><p>Lou Sulola Samuel is the last child of Heidi Klum and Seal. The girl was born on Oct. 9, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. She is now 14 years old. Talking about her birth, her father Seal explained that&nbsp;from the moment she looked into both his eyes and those of Heidi, it was endless love at first sight.</p><p>Leni Klum and her siblings have formed a close bond over the years and they also love their parents. Leni is very close to her mother and has posed on different magazines covers with her. Leni credits her mom with helping her become who she is today.</p><h3><strong>Leni Klum’s Parents are No Longer Together</strong></h3><p>Sadly, Leni’s parents Heidi Klum and Seal are no more together. The couple has since divorced and parted ways. While they were married, Heidi Klum and Seal were very fond of each other and renewed their vows to one another every year on their anniversary in front of family and friends. It appeared that they were going to last forever as a couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Seal-and-Leni.jpg><p>However, things took a dramatic and sad turn on 22 January 2012, when the couple shocked fans by announcing that they were separating after almost seven years of marriage. The development left many people startled because the couple had appeared to be a perfect fit. Eventually, Heidi Klum filed for divorce from Seal on 6 April 2012 and requested that her name be restored to her birth name. Sadly, the divorce was finalized on 14 October 2014.</p><p>In the statement they released about the matter, the couple explained that the divorce was an amicable one and that there is no bad blood between them as they both had the greatest respect for one another. They revealed that the well-being of their kids was their biggest priority. However, even though the couple claimed they were splitting amicably, reports began to emerge that Klum and Seal battled a number of issues before the marriage eventually collapsed.</p><p>Reports claimed that Heidi Klum decided to divorce <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">because of Seal’s hot temper</a>. It was claimed that Klum was worried about Seal’s inability to control his temper and the effect it was having on their children. There were also reports that Seal was partying way too hard and Klum was fed up with this. Their very hectic work schedules also pulled them apart and everything came crashing down.</p><p>Despite their split, the former couple is working hard to be awesome co-parents to their kids. Leni is especially very fond of Seal and has been pictured with him on different occasions. In October 2021, Leni made a red carpet appearance with Seal at a screening of the Netflix film “The Harder They Fall”. The pair looked simply dashing and photos of both of them went viral.</p><p>Information about the elementary or high schools that Leni Klum attended remains quite vague at the moment. However, in 2020, the model revealed that during the lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, she had to change to different schools and only knew most of her classmates via zoom.</p><h2><strong>Leni Klum is Building an Amazing Modeling Career</strong></h2><p>Leni Klum is taking after her mother and is slowly rising to become one of the highly sought-after supermodels in the world. She started taking interest in modeling when she was very little especially because she kept watching her mother go on modeling trips and get involved in fashion shows and events. She imagined herself cat-walking on runways and appearing on magazine covers like her mother.</p><p>Even though she was still just a child, Leni began to carry herself like a model, just like her mother, and this glaring fact was not lost on agencies. Soon, when she was about 12 or 13 years old, Leni revealed that she got her first-ever modeling offer from Brandy Melville, a fashion company she loves. According to her, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">she was shopping with her mother</a> at the time and so excited about the deal that really wanted to take the offer but her mother refused, explaining that Leni was too young to go into modeling and that she had to wait till she was at least 16.</p><p>Leni’s love for modeling was heightened even more some years later when she accompanied her mother to the set of Germany’s Next Topmodel, a German modeling/fashion TV show. Leni’s mom was the host of the show and sits on the judge’s panel so it was easy for her to bring Leni along. While the show was going on, Leni saw contestants being challenged to take photos mid-air while they jumped off a building. This caught her interest so she asked her mother if she could also take part in jumping and having her photo taken and her mother agreed.</p><p>The experience was incredible for Leni who felt, at that very moment, that modeling was what she wanted to do with her life. Her mother Heidi also revealed, once, that her daughter loved coming to the set of the modeling show to just see models do what they had to do and learn from them. It was clear to everyone that Leni was completely interested in becoming a model and was ready to take on the role.</p><h2><strong>Who has Leni Klum Modeled for?</strong></h2><p>Leni Klum has modeled for several big brands, including Vogue, among others. She made her modeling debut in December 2020 by posing for the January/February 2021 issue of Vogue Germany alongside her mother, Heidi Klum. Leni was 16 years old at the time this happened. She was ecstatic! It was no small feat for anyone to make their debut as a model by posing for a magazine as prestigious as Vogue Germany.</p><p>In the cover photo, Heidi Klum is seen gently planting a smooch on her teen daughter’s cheek while Leni looks into the camera with her hands confidently in her pocket. In another photo, the mother rests her head on her daughter’s shoulder. Heidi Klum was extremely proud of her daughter’s achievement and proudly made this known on her social media pages. She expressed her immense joy at her daughter’s incredible start to modeling as well as her anticipation that Leni would enjoy a great modeling career.</p><p>Leni Klum has since gone ahead to do other great things. In January 2021, the model made her runway debut during Berlin Fall/Winter 2021 Fashion Week, stunning many onlookers with her confidence and charm. At the event, Leni appeared in a digital presentation promoting several designers, including Kaviar Gauche and Michael Sontag.</p><p>Some months later, in April 2021, Leni Klum followed in her supermodel mother’s footsteps by landing her first solo magazine cover on Glamour Germany. It is noteworthy that Leni’s mother, Heidi had graced the same magazine cover about 20 years earlier during the publication’s inaugural issue in 2001. Heidi was very proud of her daughter and quickly expressed this on Instagram by sharing the photo online. In the picture, Leni Klum is seen striking a pose in a floral-print dress complete with whimsical sleeves.</p><p>A few more months later, in August 2021, Leni Klum returned to the runway and walked the catwalk at the Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda fashion show in Venice, Italy. Leni found a lot of support there because her mother and other family members also joined her for the trip and sat front-row at the show to watch and cheer her. The same month, Leni wowed in a cover shoot for Rollacoaster magazine.</p><p>On September 11, 2021, Leni, who was already 17 years old at the time, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">walked the runway </a>at German online retailer About You’s Berlin Fashion Week show. Like she did before, Leni also wowed the audience with her grace and charm. This time, she also appeared as a designer and actually showcased designs from her own branded collection. It was clear to all that, Leni was becoming a superstar top model in her own right.</p><p>In December 2021, Leni Klum and her mother Heidi both featured on the cover page of Elle Rusia. The elated Leni quickly shared the photo on her Instagram page, expressing her love for her mother.</p><p>In the same month of December 2021, Leni featured alone in the international fashion magazine, Numero Russia. Leni has also posed for other magazines and outfits including Elle USA, Creative Artists Agency, Chopard, and others.</p><h2><strong>How Tall is Leni Klum?</strong></h2><p>Leni Klum is 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) tall. Her body measurements are 36-24-35 inches or 91.44-60.96-88.9 cm for her bust, waist, and hips respectively.</p><h3><strong>Leni Klum is More Than Just a Model</strong></h3><p>Because of what she has already achieved so far, it is expected that Leni Klum will continue doing exploits in the world of modeling and fashion just like her mother has done, and maybe even surpass the older Klum in the process. However, modeling is not the only thing she does with herself. She has been able to channel her creative energy into other ventures.</p><p>We found out that the model is actually an avid dancer and has even trained with Abby Lee Miller, the popular American dance instructor, choreographer, reality television personality. According to Leni, her experience training as a dancer with Abby Lee Miller is what has helped her lose her stage fright when she is on the runway.</p><p>Leni Klum is also a budding environmentalist. In fact, the young woman has started a project with Plant-for-the-Planet called Klum Forest to plant trees in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. This very bold move has been hailed by many people who see Leni as one of the young people who would change the world with her deep concern about protecting the environment as time goes on.</p><p>Also, Leni is interested in fashion design. The young woman wants to become a powerhouse in fashion design and create lines that would become globally famous. Leni hopes to attend fashion or art school in New York and become better equipped with all she needs to achieve her dreams.&nbsp;Already, the model has created a clothing line for About You, a German e-commerce site. The clothing line actually opened Berlin Fashion Week where Leni and her friends modeled. Apparently, things are already looking very good for Leni.</p><h2><strong>What is Leni Klum’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>There has been a lot of discussion about how much Leni Klum is worth at the moment. This is because of her great exploits so far as a model and how much potential she has shown in the industry. It is believed that she has raked in quite a lot of money for herself already. Having strutted down different runways around the world and, having featured on prominent magazines covers, it is very safe to say that Leni has pulled in a considerable amount of money for herself. But how much is she worth?</p><p>At the moment, the exact net worth of Leni Klum is not very certain. However, different sources are reporting her net worth to be between $500,000 to $1 million. Of course, it is expected that this figure will increase with time as she continues her exploits as a model and fashion designer.</p><h3><strong>She Has a Massive Social Media Presence</strong></h3><p>For every model, social media is a very big tool to project themselves and their works to the world and this is no different for Leni Klum.

This is massive considering the fact that her career has just kickstarted in earnest. However, Leni pales in comparison to her mother’s social media presence; Heidi currently has more than 9 million followers on Instagram.</p><p>Leni Klum’s Instagram page is mainly filled with posts about her work. There are several photos and videos showing her doing what she does best which pose for magazine covers and walk the runway. She also shows behind the scenes of her photoshoots and all the hard work that goes into creating the incredible shots that people see and enjoy.</p><p>However, work is not all that Leni posts about; she also posts occasionally about her family.
